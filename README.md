# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Predictor

## Overview

The Breast Cancer Diagnosis app is a machine learning-powered tool designed to assist medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer. Using a set of measurements, the app predicts whether a breast mass is benign or malignant. It provides a visual representation of the input data using a radar chart and displays the predicted diagnosis and probability of being benign or malignant.

The app can be used by manually inputting the measurements or by connecting it to a cytology lab to obtain the data directly from a machine. **Note:** The connection to the laboratory machine is not a part of the app itself.

This app was developed as a machine learning exercise using the public dataset [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)). Please note that this dataset may not be reliable for real-world clinical use. This project was created for educational purposes only.
